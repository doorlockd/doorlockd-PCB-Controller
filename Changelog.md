Doorlockd-PCB-Controller version 2.0 components 2025-09-11
==========================================================
 - Heavily revised version of Doorlockd-PCB-BBB, modified to use Milk-V
   Duo S or Rock Pi S instead of Beaglebone Black. This version also
   adds a bit of stripboard for customizations and has a bit more
   flexible IO instead of fixed-function LED and button connectors.
